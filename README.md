This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


I created 2 version of the Frontend UI version for the Intern Assignment for [Electura}(https://www.electura.co/)
1. Version1: This version is simple looking and cart feature is implemented into it.
2. Version2: This version is very much exotic looking when compared to the V1. I wanted to implement the cart function not in homepage but in courses tab. Due to time restrictions and lack of proper knowledge, I wasn’t able to implement cart function in the “Courses” Section.
